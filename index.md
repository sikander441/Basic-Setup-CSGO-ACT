## Welcome to ACT CSGO Tournament

Following are the most basic things you need to set up and be ready before your match starts, Make sure you check MOSS once that it works and understand how to get access to the lobby below.



### MOSS

 You need to set up MOSS, it is kind of an anti-cheat software that collects data from your system when you run the game to make sure you are not hacking:
 

1.) Go to the website to download MOSS: [nohope.eu](https://nohope.eu) 

2.) On the right hand side, download MOSS as shown in the image below

 I have highligted the 64-bit version you can select the middle one for 32-bit system.
 
3.) Extract the zip to some location on your computer and run the executable(.exe) file presend under the extracted location.( Be sure you don't have CSGO opened when you do this. close it before opening MOSS).

4.) After the app launched click on File - > Parameters and select Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as shown in the image below

 NOTE: You have to do this just once, it will save those parameters.
 
 Click OK to save the parameter.
 
5.) After saving the parameter and coming back to MOSS main application, click on Capture -> Start (Again make sure CSGO is not opened otherwise this will fail).

6.) The MOSS application will show the message that Counter-Strike:Global Offensive Capture is Running. Now you can launch the game and start playing.

7.) After you are done with your match, you can stop the caputre by going to the MOSS app and capture -> Stop. After it stops succesfully it will show the location of the zip that was created as shown in the image:

8.) Upload this zip to the discord group as told by the admin.



### Joining the Lobby

 Once you are added to the whatsapp group, from there you will be asked to joing a voice server on discord with a given lobby number.
 
 So be ready and join the Discord server before-hand, link: [Discord link](https://discord.gg/RHdaSM)
 
 NOTE: Even after joining group not able to see the lobby? You need to get access for the  lobbies first. For that you click on the section with the Date of your match and under that the discussion named #get-role will be present.
 
 Click on get-role, you will see a message asking you to react to a message(example screenshot below). Once you react you will be given access to the lobbies and you will be able to see the lobbies and join the lobby number asked to you by the admin.
